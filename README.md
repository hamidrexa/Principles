# Principles
 1. **Meaningful Authentic Purpose**
 2. **10x better or easier / pmf / push vs pull**
	 1. Trends (mobile, social, cloud/on-demand, big data, crypto, align price with use, etc) / timing / avoid status quo bias
	 2. Customer obsession / Empathetic / Human-centered
	 3. Think outside the box
	 4. Impact assessment / Value-chain analysis
	 5. Addressing non-consumers/Non-suppliers / Start with Low-end segment
		 1. Inspire
		 2. Empower them by removing a single barrier:

	 6. Don't shrink the pie, grow the pie / Competition is for losers / Bring value to the game / Complement, don’t compete / Never compete on price / Think about co-opetition
	 7. Unbundling / Subtraction against the feature death loop / less is more / Improve by eliminating
	 8. Biz model innovation >> Product innovation / When the competition gets tough, change the game
	 9. Address the root cause, not the symptom / Correlation isn’t causation
 
 3. **Positive Feedback Loop / network effect / compound effect / flywheel effect**
	 1. Single-player mode -> GoTo Principle 2 (10x better) 
		 * Come for the tool, stay for the network 
	 2. Create a Community for one-side (rate&review, Q&A, Forums etc)

 6. **Day “0” test / sunk cost fallacy**
 7. **Proprietary growth channel**
	 1. Growth products
	 2. Product-led growth
 8. **Path to profitability (Revenue/Growth margin trending)**
 9. **Stay in the middle of Money flow | Predictability**
 10. **Moat / Defensibility**
	 1. AI Flywheel / Data Network Effect / Data Moat/Data Product vs Feature / Real-time Nature

	 3. Vertical integration
 11. **Toothbrush test / frequency of usage**
 12. **Own the customer relationship**
